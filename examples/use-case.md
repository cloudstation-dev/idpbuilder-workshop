🏗️ Analogy: Opening a New Restaurant in a Smart City

Imagine you're in a futuristic smart city, and you want to open a new restaurant (let’s say it's called “Nginx Diner”).

Normally, opening a restaurant would take weeks — you'd need to register the business, hire staff, build the place, set up the kitchen, register it in delivery apps, and let the city know it exists.

But now, thanks to automation, you just press one button, and this happens:

🍽️ Restaurant Blueprint (Backstage Template)
You start with a digital form that describes what kind of restaurant you want — name, location, cuisine. This is your Backstage software template.

🏗️ Construction Company Assigned (Gitea Repo)
Immediately, the system creates a construction site and assigns a builder — this is the new Git repository in Gitea that will contain the code and infrastructure for your restaurant.

🚀 Automated Launch (ArgoCD + GitOps)
The city’s automation system (ArgoCD) notices the new blueprint and starts deploying the restaurant infrastructure in Kubernetes — plumbing, electricity, kitchen... everything is set up using GitOps, just by syncing the Git repo.

🗺️ Put on the Map (Backstage Component)
Once everything is running, the restaurant is registered on the city map (Backstage catalog). Now everyone in the city (your developers) can see it, access it, and even request updates or improvements.
